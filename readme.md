#TDSR
This is a console-based screen reader.
It has been tested under macOS and Linux.
(However, no Linux speech server currently exists.)

##What works
* Reading output
* Reading by line, word and character
* cursor keys (waits some amount of time and speaks)

##Note
Compatibility is not guaranteed between versions.
##Requirements
* Python 3
* pyte
* speech server

##Installation on macOS
1. Install Python 3. If using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), `brew install python3`.
1. Clone this repository.
```git clone https://github.com/tspivey/tdsr.git```
1. cd tdsr
1. pip3 install -Ur requirements.txt
1. Assuming the repository is in ```~/tdsr```, run:
`~/tdsr/tdsr`
and it should start speaking.

##Terminal setup
Open Terminal preferences, under Profiles check Use Option as Meta key.
##Keys
(alt refers to the meta key.)
* alt u, i, o - read previous, current, next line
* alt j, k, l - read previous, current, next word
* alt m, comma, dot - read previous, current, next character
* alt k twice - spell current word
* alt comma twice - say current character phonetically
* alt c - config.
* alt q - quiet mode on/off. When on, text is not automatically read.
* alt r - start/end selection.
* alt v - copy mode. Press l to copy the line the review cursor is on, or s to copy the screen.

##Configuration
Once in the config menu, you can use:
* r - set rate.
* v - set volume (value between 0 and 100).
* p - toggle symbol processing.
* d - set cursor delay (in MS). The default is 20.
* Enter - exit, saving the configuration.

##Symbols
Symbols can be added in the configuration file (```~/.tdsr.cfg```),
under the symbols section.

The format is:
```
character code = name
```
Because of how the config system works, it's best to do this with one TDSR open, then exit and re-launch to see the changes.
